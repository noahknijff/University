## Course Structure:

### Agent Based Modeling
- **Description:** (SEE Agent Based Modelinlg/README.md)

### Computational Finance
- **Description:** In this section, I explore methods used in financial modeling, including Monte Carlo simulations and the COS method for option pricing.
- **Notebooks:**
  - Cos_method.ipynb – This notebook explores the COS method, a Fourier transform-based technique for option pricing.
  - Digital_Option_MC.ipynb – This notebook uses Monte Carlo simulations to price digital options.

### Data Mining Techniques
- **Description:** This section contains projects on data cleaning, clustering, and classification. The notebooks demonstrate techniques for handling class room google-form submitted datasets and extracting useful insights.
- **Notebooks:**
  - DMT_Group_157_Assignment_1.ipynb – A group project on data mining techniques, including preprocessing and analysis of a dataset.

### Differential Geometry
- **Description:** In this section, I apply mathematical principles from differential geometry to analyze surfaces, curvature, and contact points in 3D space.
- **Notebooks:**
  - Curvature_3D.ipynb – This notebook analyzes the curvature of 3D surfaces using numerical methods.
  - Surface_Contact.ipynb – Examines the concept of contact between a point on a surface with its surrounding environment using differential geometry.
